<p>Okay so this is supposed to be a dev diary of sorts for monchain. Will do a longer write-up in the future for interested parties. Mostly am thinking about fleshing out the battle mechanics so people can try it out more at Denver. Also thinking about the prediction market / betting mechanisms. Noticed some small width issues when testing / copy-paste today so have to go fix those. Also paying attention to layouts / art inspiration from earlier 1980's style anime, as well as more recent gacha games. Will add some images and moodboard stuff later.</p>

<p>Mostly finishing the major archetypes for the mons. Also thinking a bit about the Saga series, should probably learn more about that. The main themes overall are letting players plan a few turns ahead, as well as risk/reward trade-offs.</p>

<p>Anyway if you haven't noticed, the blog name is a pun on the battle log.</p>

<p>Also thinking about some sort of monchain idiosyncratic explorer so users can better understand what the point of the on-chain nature is, and why it's interesting. That could be a cool thing in and of itself, so gotta avoid getting distracted.</p>

<p>End goal is still a cool enough game that can rope in communities. Everything else is in service of that for now.</p>
