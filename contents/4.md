# calc

Okay so finalizing the stats for the next iteration. [calc.moncha.in](calc.moncha.in) is the link for those interested.

Basically lets you edit/play around with stats, most importantly calculating the amount of damage you need to KO a mon. Will add more data to it as well later.

Next mons (in in particular order) will probably be:

- llamamon
- beramon
- megamon
