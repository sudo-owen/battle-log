okay so post denver basically need to focus on the mobile aspect

several ppl "got it" and enjoyed trying it out.

need faster chain, snappier client, more varied gameplay, better cues on what to do.

but mobile client was a brilliant idea.

getting the game up and running was easy enough for almost everyone.

as we develop the new metagame, need a good enough client for everyone to use

will rethink the lobby later

rn adding enough "juice"/flash to the mobile client to make it feel good for on-the-go testing

expect new client soon

and then new contracts
