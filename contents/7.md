[risk vs reward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXqEykD5Ub4&list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLScUWJZ7ppkHGlCUIXEj5Io)

- in general want to tie good payoff with good risks
- players should feel like they are in tight situations
- for monchain, make players stay in, remove safe options
- e.g. if you have to stay in an extra round to trigger some high variance effect, that could be good
- otherwise make players have to take damage in order to make things happen
- the closer you are to losing, the more options for countering should open up (?) or maybe not, depends on how much skill expression you want. (less catchup necessarily implies more skill)
- another way is to reward players for longer-term planning (e.g. over multiple turns)

[clarity vs style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjW_TTNtXEM)

- visual clarity vs immersion
- for monchain, obviously pokemon / rpg influence
- what are in-universe justifications for the controls / menus?
 - lean a bit more into digital angle (digimon / chaotix esque)?
 - giving commands, deciding a strategy, making a decision
 - e.g. if you were "in the mind" of the mon, then you'd represent it as a series of options
 - simplifying the menu could also work, but e.g. the persona 5 feel of a stylized menu really adds to the flair
    - but the persona menu isn't representing something in-universe, it's just something external / flashy, like how speed lines don't exist in-universe.
    - so e.g. the right direction is something like cool pixelly boxes if we go all-in on the pixel art aesthetic

[squeeze and release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYh5SJb5gWk&list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLScUWJZ7ppkHGlCUIXEj5Io&index=3)

- giving players tension, and then ways to reduce that tension can form a good abstract game loop
- for monchain, need to think about what outside (or inside!) pvp can form that, it's not compelling enough as-is probably
- simple method: gate mons, and do unlocking / teambuilding
- this is what sources and sinks can also be complementary to, sinks are from sources that come from relieving tension. it's a different lens.
