# next steps

i feel like it'll be hard to do each mon at a time, so probably best to try and figure out:

- stat spreads
- one characteristic for each mon
- test and add it in, keep the placeholders for the rest
- slowly add in more tests for each additional mechanic
- avoids having one super fleshed out mon and the rest of the placeholder mons
