# b(attle) log: start

Okay so this is supposed to be a dev diary of sorts for monchain. Will do a longer write-up in the future for interested parties. Mostly am thinking about fleshing out the battle mechanics so people can try it out more at Denver. Also thinking about the prediction market / betting mechanisms. Noticed some small width issues when testing / copy-paste today so have to go fix those. Also paying attention to layouts / art inspiration from earlier 1980's style anime, as well as more recent gacha games. Will add some images and moodboard stuff later.

Mostly finishing the major archetypes for the mons. Also thinking a bit about the Saga series, should probably learn more about that. The main themes overall are letting players plan a few turns ahead, as well as risk/reward trade-offs.

Anyway if you haven't noticed, the blog name is a pun on the battle log.

Also thinking about some sort of monchain idiosyncratic explorer so users can better understand what the point of the on-chain nature is, and why it's interesting. That could be a cool thing in and of itself, so gotta avoid getting distracted.

End goal is still a cool enough game that can rope in communities. Everything else is in service of that for now.
