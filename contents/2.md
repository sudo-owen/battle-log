# brief writeup of the initial mons

Okay, let's talk specifics of some of the various mons and how I see them playing out. Reminder that monchain is supposed to play a lot like Pokemon, rewarding taking risks at the right time, as well as predictions. 

(This will keep getting updated)

(you should go to the [wiki](https://monchain.xyz) to get the newest data! )

## BELOW IS OLD STUFF

## Sofabbi

<img src="./assets/sofabbi_front.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/sofabbi_back.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/sofabbi_mini.gif" class="mini-img">

This one was pretty easy to find a theme. It's the RNG mon, based off the gacha wheel found in Sofamon. Play style is a safe-ish pivot that can soak up damage and pull off occasional clip-worthy knockouts.

Stat spread: overall middling in everything. Balanced attack/defense, slightly higher HP than usual, slightly lower speed than usual.

**Ability: Spin The Wheel**

Every move has a 33% chance of refunding 1 stamina.

**Moves**

- RNG damage move, 3 stamina, some spread of RNG damage, maybe 10/20/40/80/160/320, could also have a few other amusing effects (eg literally RNG, could be a status move, instant kill, or even damaging yourself, this feels the most fun)
- Normal damage, 2 stamina.
- Normal damage, 2 stamina, maybe some % to inflict status.
- Heal (need to cap this somehow) by consuming all available stamina, heal by % equal to the amount of stamina needed.

Rough philosophy is to have Sofabbi run at a slightly more efficient stamina economy, and the final heal move lets it benefit from that more than another mon. Main balancing question is probably needing to make its average moveset energy costs higher to offset.

## Inutia

<img src="./assets/inutia_front.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/inutia_back.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/inutia_mini.gif" class="mini-img">

Inutia borrows from Initia (hi Jennie). So we wanna lean into making it relatively nimble, but probably not very strong to balance it.

Stat spread: higher than average speed, lower than average on other areas. (Sort of glass cannon, except more like utility mon. Good suicide lead.)

**Ability: need name**

Something to benefit from swapping in and out, e.g. inflict a minor status debuff on the opponent when swapped in.
Maybe something both for swap in and swap out, to encourage the in/out playstyle.
Has to be a relatively minor buff/debuff then. (Eg half the benefit of a normal swap)

**Moves**

- Damage + swap, 1 stamina (?), allows you to hit, then swap out to another mon (maybe some slight buff?), very low damage, moreso for the swap.
- Stage hazard + team buff (but limited uses), 4 stamina, deals damage to opponent on swap in, heals your team on swap in.
- Damage placeholder
- Damage placeholder

Is hazards + swap too strong of a combo? Maybe if it's predictable there should be some counterplay, will need to monitor in prod.

## Ghouliath

<img src="./assets/ghouliath_front.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/ghouliath_back.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/ghouliath_mini.gif" class="mini-img">

Man oh man. The ghouls. Ghouliath is also designed to be a weird tricky attacker. Mostly there to weather/tank hits that you can't deal with otherwise.

Stat spread: average stats, maybe slightly higher than average attack.

**Ability: Rise From The Grave**

An example of one of the cool things we can do w/ programmable mons. Once per game, if Ghouliath dies, it revives after 3 turns, with 1 HP. (Not sure if 1 HP debuff is needed to balance it out, as it effectively behaves like Disguise on Mimikyu and other free-turn moves, could also balance it out with lower stats, but we'll see)

**Moves**

- spook on opponent + damage, 2 stamina, -1 priority (probably)
- damage, 0 stamina (1 stamina?), inflicts spook on self (interesting way to bypass energy economy, but self-spook probably needs a way to handle it more elegantly, but it's flavorful)
- some sort of perish song variant, eg both mons die in 3 turns unless they swap out (probably need to balance this as well somehow)
    - or, especially because Ghouliath can already die easily, make it more like Ghouliath KO's themself, and then adds some persistent curse to the opposing mon
- damage placeholder

## Pengym

<img src="./assets/pengym_front.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/pengym_back.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/pengym_mini.gif" class="mini-img">

It's a cute penguin. This and Gorillax are supposed to be easier to think about.

Stat spread: speedier/attack up, lower defenses.

**Ability: idk yet**

maybe something that rewards staying in / attacking which newer players will gravitate towards.

**Moves**

- Damage + % to inflict frostbite,
- Big damage, but only if opponent is frostbitten
- Stat boost
- Damage placeholder

idk, need some boring/normal mons, need to think a bit more flavorfully, maybe something that incorporates the little pengus as well.

## Gorillax

<img src="./assets/gorillax_front.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/gorillax_back.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/gorillax_mini.gif" class="mini-img">

bored ape. need to lean into the zero brain mindset, risking it all for bonuses

Stat spread: higher attack/hp, lower on other stats.

**Ability: Angery**

Every time Gorillax gets hit, gain a charge. Consume all charges at end of turn to heal (maybe a move should do this vs doing it automatically? idk can tune it more later).

**Moves**

- Lose Yourself: drops HP to 1, maxes out attack stat
- Damage + % status maybe
- Damage placeholder
- Damage placeholder

Basically can encourage moves to damage self to build up healing meter

## Malalien

<img src="./assets/malalien_front.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/malalien_back.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/malalien_mini.gif" class="mini-img">

milady.

Stat spread: high speed/attack, low defenses.

Focus on weird status conditions, being "hacked", general lawlessness. Taunting or ways of restricting opponents works well. Probably a custom status condition.

**Ability: Cursed**

When KO'ed, inflict some nasty status on the attacker. Maybe sleep. That would suck.

(We kinda just gave this to Ghouliath, so we can either keep, or we can find something different. A powerful effect on swap-in would synergize well with Inutia and encourage the hit-and-run playstyle)

**Moves**

- Get Rekt, 2 stamina, reflects some existing status condition onto the opponent, maybe does some extra damage if so.
- Bully, 3 stamina, deals damage based on remaining stamina, punishes those who stay in, maybe also drains 1 stamina (is this too strong?)
- Damage placeholder
- Damage placeholder

## Iblivion

<img src="./assets/iblivion_front.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/iblivion_back.gif" class="sprite-img"><img src="./assets/iblivion_mini.gif" class="mini-img">

Based off the weird Baseline happy face ghosts. IBLV personified.

End-game mon, designed to grow over time. Try to capture the feeling of being able to grow while leveraging existing growth to fill out the other attributes.

Stat spread: lower than average on everything (but will get stronger)

**Ability: IBLV**

tbd, something to do with regen maybe (eg healing up to X% of damage dealt, as long as Iblivion survives)

**Moves**

- Up Only, 0 stamina, both damage and stamina go up with each usage (capped at 5 stacks)
- Loop, 1 stamina, recovers stamina to full (is this OP?)
- Damage placeholder
- Damage placeholder
